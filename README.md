# AtlasCore - Run OpenClaw without breaking your PC

## A Desktop Sandbox for OpenClaw
**AtlasCore** is a desktop sandbox which designed with seamless compatibility and robust isolation at its core, enables OpenClaw to operate with the same full functionality, responsiveness, and behavioral consistency as it does on a physical, unvirtualized operating system. 

This sandbox acts as a high-fidelity digital replica of a real desktop environment—mirroring the underlying OS architecture, system libraries, command-line interfaces, and permission frameworks—ensuring that every OpenClaw capability, from skill execution and system command invocation to policy management, performs identically to its behavior on a native system.

Supported OS: **macOS 12.6+** and **Windows 10/11**.

## Why this matters
- Prevent accidental or malicious overreach: AtlasCore reduces the blast radius if OpenClaw requests or executes unintended actions.
- Reduce leakage risk: OpenClaw only accesses and uses data within AtlasCore; local device data will not be damaged or leaked.
- Eliminate friction between OpenClaw and the host OS: OpenClaw can interact with simulated system resources, execute scripts, and modify execution policies exactly as it would on a real desktop—all without exposing the host system to risks associated with untrusted commands, arbitrary executable runs, or policy modifications
- Explore OpenClaw's full capabilities: AtlasCore empowers developers, testers, and users to explore OpenClaw's full capabilities—including high-risk operations like policy customization and executable testing—without compromising the integrity of their native environment.
- Preserve native essence while enhancing value: AtlasCore ensures that OpenClaw's power is never limited by security concerns, and that security is never achieved at the cost of functionality.
- Reduce costs: No need to purchase an additional Mac mini, reducing equipment investment.
