# AtlasCore - Run OpenClaw without breaking your PC

## Run OpenClaw inside Atlascore
**AtlasCore** is a desktop sandbox which creates a secure barrier that isolates OpenClaw from the devices local environment, and prevents the overly permissive access Moltbox may request from leading to security vulnerabilities.

When run without proper isolation, OpenClaw can obtain broad access and perform actions far outside its intended scope. AtlasCore’s sandbox approach enforces boundaries and least-privilege practices so OpenClaw can operate secure.

Supported OS: **macOS 12.6+** and **Windows 10/11**.

## Why this matters
- Prevents accidental or malicious overreach: AtlasCore reduces the blast radius if OpenClaw requests or executes unintended actions.
- Reduces leakage risk: OpenClaw only accesses and uses data within AtlasCore; local device data will not be damaged or leaked.
- Full functionality usage: The virtual environment provided by AtlasCore is the same as the device's operating system, and all of OpenClaw's functions work normally within AtlasCore.
- Reduced costs: No need to purchase an additional Mac Mini, reducing equipment investment.
