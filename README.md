# Moltbot in AtlasCore — A Secure Sandbox

## Running Moltbot inside Atlascore
**AtlasCore** is a kind of sandbox which creates a secure barrier that isolates Moltbot from the devices local environment, and prevents the overly permissive access Moltbox may request from leading to security vulnerabilities.

When run without proper isolation, Moltbot can obtain broad access and perform actions far outside its intended scope. AtlasCore’s sandbox approach enforces boundaries and least-privilege practices so Moltbot can operate secure.

Supported OS: **macOS 12.6+** and **Windows 10/11**.

## Why this matters
- Prevents accidental or malicious overreach: AtlasCore reduces the blast radius if Moltbot requests or executes unintended actions.
- Reduces leakage risk: Moltbot only accesses and uses data within AtlasCore; local device data will not be damaged or leaked.
- Full functionality usage: The virtual environment provided by AtlasCore is the same as the device's operating system, and all of Moltbot's functions work normally within AtlasCore.
- Reduced costs: No need to purchase an additional Mac Mini, reducing equipment investment.
